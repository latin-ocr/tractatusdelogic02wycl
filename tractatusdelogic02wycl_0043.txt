become to increase our knowledge. Nor can there be any lirnit to the
raising of a pile indefinitely high (p. 139, l. 19—30). —- All this is
absolutely denied. We know by saith that the Saints in Heaven do really
attain their maximum limit of possible knowledge by means of the
beatific vision Of God. The question how this can be - 3 favourite one
both with Mediaeval and with modern Scholastics v— is discussed at
some length. The blessed are not infinitely more perfect than we; for
their knowledge is an accidental privilege, not an essentia] attribute.
Wyclif inclines to think that they see all things in God; but, however
this may be, the essence of felicity consists in the sight of God Himself3
even were they ignorant of something, they would none the less be
perfectly happy (p. 168, l. ιο 10 p. 174, 1. 18). Α5 10 1116 raising of a
pile indefinitely high, of course the higher it went, the more difficult it
would be to raise it any further; and there would come a point at
which it would exhaust all the powers os the whole human race to get
even one more stone to the summit. Thus, Nature imposes a limit to
men in all things; excessive increase of anything, for instance, of
Chzzrclz ceremonies aud possessiom, is hurtful. This is a seed which at
a later period developed into an enorinous tree (p. 174, 1. 33 to
p. 175, 1. 22).

6. A minimum of visibility is absurd. Seeing a surface, we see
the whole of it, and therefore we confusedly see all its parts, even to
the infinitely small. — But Wyclif posits 35 an cvitlent principle that
whatever is seen confuscdly might, under other circumstances, be slis-
tinctly seen. This takes 311 1116 force out of the objection. Α mathe-
matical point cannot be seen (listinctly under any circumstances; for the
smallest thing visible must bc the base of a pyramid having its apex in
the eye. The chapter comes to a close with some details on the struc-
ture and organisrn of the eye, which may be curious as representing
the state of optical science in those (lays; but I am not in 3 position
to discuss them thoroughly; scarcely at all. As Wyclif avowedly takes
most of what he says from the works‚ not only of Alhazen‚ but also of the
famous Vitellio (Ciolek> of Cracow, one of the most celebrated opticians
in the Middle Ages, I should have liked to compare his anatomical
description with the summary given by our author. Unfortunately‚ the
work in question was not in the Jagellonian Library when I asked for
it, having been lent out at some distance from Cracow3 but the English
