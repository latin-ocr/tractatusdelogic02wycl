shorter time (Ο) 3 311131161· power, A‘, would be able to bear this same
weight Β, 11113, 111 1116 opinion of the adversaries, would prove that no
power has a special maximum 01 113 own (p. 138, l. 38 to p. 139, l. 9).
Wyclif answers here at great length (pp. 152— 162), giving many diffe-
rent senses of the word Ε(1111161111γῆ but we need not go into them. The
gist 01 1113 reply (p. 159, l. 4—10) is 11131 1116 notion of a maximum
must here be considered with regard to the time, and not apart. We
may, however, in this long and discursive reply, note several striking
sentences, some paradoxical, some quaint, and some proving a con-
siderable knowledge of mechanics‚ as then known. “Of all difficult
things —— i. e. 01 111036 which deteriorale the agent that does them —
mortal sin is the most difficult (p. 155, l. 26, 27>.³' “In the sense of
esomething to be mastered³‚ the universe is a difficulty to God Himself
(p. 156, l. 20—25).'' “Withont God's aid we should find it as difficult
to move a bean as to make a world (p. 157, l. 29—31).³³ e“In the act
01 sustaining, much depends on the manner of application 01 1116 weight,
An egg will not be crushed even by 3 considerable force; 3 3311 will
bear up against a strong wind3 and experiments with levers prove this
abundantly and in a marvellous way (multa . . . mirabilia facere, p. 160,
l. 25—34).³' “The least weight a man cannot sustain is the greatest
that he can (p. 160, Ι, 34-37).” “weight implies distance from the
centre‚ or from the proper sphere 01 each element; water in its own
sphere 1133 110 weight, as divers tell us, and I suppose that it is the
same for the earth too (p. 161, l. 14—16).’'

4. The biggest or the smallest man possible is impossible. If the
former got a bump (tunsionem), l1e would then be too big to exist. If
the latter lost a hair (quamlibet ablationem partis superfluae), lie would
be 100 small. -— This humorous argument is answered on p. 167
(l. 34 & seq.) where it is pointed ont that, though the greatest possible
giant could not assimilate any more food, so long as his body remained
01 11131 size, a swelling would not render his organism, as a living body,
any the larger. And a similar train 01 reasoning would apply to the
smallest dwarf. But before this reply, we come to 3 very interesting
digression (pp. 162—166). VVyclif, admitting 3 minimum of size for all
bodily substances‚ implicitly asserts the existence of atoms from the very
ontset <minima naturalia3 p. 162, l.11); and a few pages later, he openly
gives them their right name (athomorum p. 166‚ l. 32). Itis too ge-
