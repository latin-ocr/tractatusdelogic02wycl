X INTRODUCTION.

To put their attack into somewhat more modern language than
the crabbed form of the text: If you say, “Socrates is an animal and
z't is an ass,³' you mean that the universal “AnimaP’ is replaced by it.
But suppose you substitute vertebrate for animal; the sense of it is at
once altered. Substitute mammal,· the sense varies again. Thus we have
an endless series of different significations given to it, each of them more
concrete, yet none ever reaching the ultimate limit of individuality. This
would be the ruin of all science3 sor we could never draw any inference
from the universal to its singulars; and between each of these it's there
could be found or imagined room for an infinite multitude of others. These
constantly changing significations would destroy the possibility of deduction.
“A is an animal; it (not A, but the animal) is a vertebrate; it (the vertebrate)
is a mammal³³ — and so on. We can never conclude that A is this singular
individual man (p. 27, l. 20—37). Wyclif answers (pp. 28—30) that,
though less universal as a predicate than its antecedent, it has as a
subject the power of standing for the same, and consequently for all the
singulars which that antecedent represents. There is indeed an endless
descent, because there is an infinite distance between any universal and
its singulars. But, when we get to the lowest species of all, we have
only accidents, that is, non-essential differences, by which the singulars
are distinguished3 so that makes no difficulty. If we say that one uni-
versal is infinitely beyond another, because it extends to more singulam,
this does not mean that it is infinite, any more than a surface, infinitely
greater than a line, would be infinite.

Beaten off on one side (as we may perhaps be allowed to suppose)
the Nominalists return to the charge on another. “You say that he does
not stand for an individual. Let us then suppose that two men, Socrates
and Plato, are running.³² The proposition, “Somebody runs‚'³ will be
true; but at the same time it will be true to add: “Socrates is not lte,
and Plato is not lze.” Now, what if no one else in the world is running
at the time? (p. 27, l. 37 to end; p. 28, l. 1—12). This however is met
(p. 30, 31) by denying that ‘he' has here the meaning of a universal
man. It is clearly a singular, meaning tlte somehody wlzo runs in both
cases, and in one of the two it could not but be false.

The third argument is aimed more directly against universals. Each
of them stands for all its singulars. But Ite, according to the supposition‚

is a universal. We may say of A, He is a king; and of Β, He is a thies.
