XXX INTRODUCTION.

Chapter VI professes to deal with those reduplicative propositions
in which there is a comparison implied; but it in reality discusses only
one of these proposstions, viz.: In so far as two things are like each
other, in 50 far they dtffer. Which means that the greater anything is,
the smaller it is, for the magnitude of its smallness is so much greater;
and so on of all qualities which are comparable with each other. Man
of common sense would at the present day no doubt solve the question
with a shrug, and they would treat no more respectfully a -problem
which Ι myself heard propounded by one of the lights of Philosophy:
What becomes of matter in the intervals' of sensation? If all men and
beasts were sound asleep at the same time, where would the world be?
The problem discussed here at length by Wyclif is certainly not more
absurd. He gives three different answers which* profess to solve the
difficulty, and proposes a fourth of his own. The arguments on either
side can hardly be of much interest, dealing with such flimsy sophisms
that we can hardly conceive their being seriously set forth by any man
in his senses; but we must remember that during the Middle Ages the
right understanding of the spirit of mathematical science was in its in-
fancy. Two points however deserve to be noticed here.

Why does Wyclif trouble himself so much about this question? Had
it been, as it seems, a mere exercise of ingenuity in verbal juggling, he
would probably have dismissed it with a few words of contempt, as he
dismisses others, by no means more puerile in themselves, calling them
Christmas jokes, “more joculantium in Natali'' (p. 14, l. 10). But the
fact is that, absurd though it may be, it is directed against his system.
In Wyclif’s theory, the universe consists of a multitude of real uni-
versals, shared by their singulars in varying degrees. Not only humanity,
amongst the rest, is thus shared‚ but also merit, demerit, size, and in
short everything intelligible almost3 certainly every quality which allows
of comparison with another. The Universal Man, if I may be allowed a
simile, is thus, with regard to its singulars, like a straight line of a
certain length, containing a number of points, infinite so far as we
know, but fixed and known to God's omniscience alone. These points
represent the number of really possible men; and their position on the
line, the degree to which Universal Humanity is shared in by each in-
dividual man. And, to carry the supposition further, this line, produced
further, would represent Animality, which includes Humanity and all its
