INTRODUCTION. XI

The same lte stands for both, and is both. And if we know the uni-
versal <Smneb0dy³‚ we also know — disjunctively of course; this is
a retort against Wyclif's argument a few pages above —— who has com-
mitted any action, however secret: it is sonfzebody (p. 28, 1. 13u—29).
Wyclif answers (pp. 32—34) by enumerating various species of uni-
versals. Some exist before their singulam, and are God's eternal ideas;
some are mere passive potentialities3 others are founded upon the in-
dividuals in which they exist; as, for instance, the idea of humanity. He
then proceeds to deny that, when we apply the universal to its singulars,
the supposition (application, or manner of using a word in a proposition)
is other than personal. Now essentia] and personal suppositions are two
very different things. When we say: “Humanity is animality together
with rationality,³³ we have essential supposition; when we say that huma-
nity comprises the man A, the man Β, &c. it is personal. In the first
case the subject stands for all that is in the predicate; in the second,
only for what is common to each of the singulars predicated. Thus, in
the case aforesaid, ‘he’ would not stand for all the attributes of A and
of B; one might be a king, the other a thief3 but lze would have nothing
to do with the kingship or the dishonesty of its singulars.

Such is, so sar as I can understand it, the position taken up by
Wyelif3 though he observes that there are many different answers to
this difficulty, some of which, in his opinion, amount to the abandonment
of the Realistic doctrine (p. 34, l. 30—35). He no doubt alludes to the
system of Moderate Realism, which, as it was followed by the. immense
majority of Schoolmen, and had, as our author himself admits⁷ the ad-
vantage of avoiding great difficulties, I may here venture to state in as
few words as possible.

When the same sign stands for a great many objects, and has
exactly the same signification when applied to one as when applied to
another, it is called a UniversaL But what is Universal? Pure Nominalists
say it is the word, and the word only; even the idea is different when
applied to different individuaIS. Thus we do not mean the same thing by
man, when we say, cA is a man,' as we do when we say, <B is a man³.
Moderate Nominalists, or Conceptualists, admit that besides the universa-
lity of the word, we have also the universality of the idea; so that sub-
jectively we do mean the same thing in the above instance; that is, we

mean our idea of humanity. But nothing farther3 there is nothing in cmy
