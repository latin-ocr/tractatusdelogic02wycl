INTRODUCTION. XLI

conclusion might be drawn from every proposition (p. 190, l. 4—30).
Wyclif's opinion is that individuation itself proceeds only from the cause
of each individual‚ and finally from G0d; but that we know the diffe-
rence between two individuals by their difference in time. Suppose, for
instance, that two sparks exactly alike are struck from a ssint succes-
sively‚ we know their difference because one was struck before the
other (p. 190, l. 30 to p. 191, l. 7). But even God Himself cannot
create the same thing twice over; nor, by the same reason, can any-
thing be anniliilated (et per idem videtur nihil posse annihilari, p. 192,
l. 8, Q). Here is the first hesitating assertion of what was later to become
so firm a doctrine, resulting in a new theory of the Eucharist.

After this, Wyclif comes to the grand question concerning certain
propositions called Insolnbles, on account of the great difficulty which
their solution offered to logicianS. They may in general be put under
the form of a conditional, as follows: If tlte present proposition be true,
A is not A. This therefore is the best place to deal with them, Before
succinctly giving Wyclif's solution, it may be interesting to state
various forms of so-called insolubles, and the answer which I fancy
a modern logician would give, if he troubled himself to find any
solution at all.

If tlze present proposition he true, A is not A. Grant that this is
exact: an absurdity follows. Deny it, and you have another: It is salse
that, even if the present proposition be true, A is not A. We see that a
mere denial of the nexus lands us in a contradiction connected with the
antecedent; whereas its admission grants the contradiction which its
consequent contains, This dialectical puzzle, as is well known, dates
from very early timeS. In the days of the Greek sophists it took a form
somewhat like this: A certain philosopher said that all Cretans were
liars3 but he was a Cretan himself: did he lie, or did he not lie? If he
lied, he spoke the truth3 and if he spoke the truth, he lied. To say
that a liar may speak the truth sometimes does but elude the difficulty:
sor he might have said: “All Cretans always ΗΕΒ) and added the words
“myself included³'‚ to exclude the possibility of an exception being made
in his favour.

This may be expressed much more briefly. Suppose a piece of
paper, with nothing written on it but: leat is written here is false.
This proposition, admitted as true, denies its own meaning; denied as
