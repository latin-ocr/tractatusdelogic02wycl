INTRODUCTION. XXIX

because of clouds that arise from the ear'th itsels. In like manner, God's
not willing me to do good (if He willed it, Ι should do good without
fail) would proceed from an obstacle on my part — my non-reception of
His grace; just as in the case of the sun’s rayS. What is not received
cannot possibly be given. But I an responsible for not receiving it
through my fault (p. 107, l. 8 to p. 108, l. ΖΟ).

So far, sin and its possibility and origin is explained in the ortho-
dox way, and reconciled with God's First and absolute Causality. But
Wyclif closes the chapter with one or two sentences which, even if
defensible, have a somewhat strange sound. God cannot but be the
First Cause of all; and therefore, though indirectly, of every act, in-
cluding sin: of the eternal truth that whatever is able to sin may sin at
some time or other; of the creation of such peccable beings; and also
of the very happening (contingentiae, p. 108, l. 33) of the act, which is
thus radically dependent upon God. We must, however, remark that there
is no attempt to six the sinfulness of any act upon God. On the con-
trary, says Wyclif, in so far as God is the author of sin, sin is good.
Whatever is true is good3 and the possibility of every sin depends
upon the everlasting truth already laid down. Thus we have a logica
deduction as follows:

A, Β, C ..... Z are severally able to sin.
We suppose the creation os A, B, C ..... Ζ.

Also that, in Wyclif’s system, what is able to sin means wlzat (at
one time or other, or in one subject or other) will actually commit
sim· for able to does not signify mere abstract possibility, but the ne-
cessity of a future happening.

Then we necessarily have that either A, ον Β, or C ..... ον Ζ
will at some instant or other of all time (either the instant a, or b, or

c Α.. or z) actually commit sin.

Here we see, not only that there is no necessity for any of the
given singulars taken in particular A, Β, C, ἃς. to sin at all, but also
that it is not necessary that the sin should take place at a given instant
of time. And as contingency is the opposite of necessity, we now see
what Wyclif means when he says that sin is of the extremest contingency
(summa contingentia); for the truth would be verified if only one of the
multitude A, Β, C, &c. sinned but once.
