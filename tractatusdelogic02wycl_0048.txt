XLIV INTRODUCTION.

words having the looks os propositions, but not their nature. They are
not absurd merely; an absurdity is not quite unmeaning; leis square
is round, clearly means an impossibility, and its denial is evidently true.
Not incoherent: The number three is fragrant, does not even seem to
mean anything but the raving of a lunatic, which no one cares to deny. Not
mere gibberish: Blitri is Blatlzro may be equally well denied or affir-
med, nobody knowing what they are, The so-called propositions in
question are in reality a peculias class of pseudo-propositions: words
which appear to have a meaning, but which falsify both themselves and
their contradictories. And this, Ι think, would be quite enough to satisfy
modern students of logie.

The idea of so simple and easy a solution did not, it would seem,
strike any of Wyclif’s contemporaries3 and he himself, though coming
nearest to it in my opinion, does not quite hit the mark. Some of thern
affirmed that such propositions were neither false nor true (p. 194,
l. 24—37). Some, that they were both true and false (p. 194, l. 38 to
p. 195, l. 14). Others, that they were in reality exceptive propositions‚
as no proposition can include itself in its own meaning (p. Ι95, l. 14 to
p.>196‚ l. 20). Some said that the words implied contradiction if unfler-
stood as they were, but they did not explain how they were to be un-
derstood otherwise (p. 196, l. 20 to p. 197, l. 20). And others again
denied that such words as proposiz‘ion, true, false, &c., could receive
universal extension (p. 197, l. 20 to p. 199, l. 9). Several other opinions
are enumerated besides (pp. loo—203). Wyclif taking the material or
grammatical side of the definition ofa proposition, saw that both subject
and predicate had meaning apart, and that they were joined by a copula;
he naturally could not see his way to denying that in such cases there
was no proposition. But then, how could it be one, isit had no meaning,
isit neither affirmed nor denied anything? Wyclif's answer (p. 203 to
end of work), comes to pretty nearly the same as the one I have given
above. It is not aproposition in the ordinary sense of the word, for, in
this ordinary sense, it has absolutely no meaning. But it exists. Whatever

exists, means its own existence. In that sense, every such proposition is

but I do not really. “What is written here is not a proposition’' in my mouth does
not contradict “What is written here is a proposition'⁷ on the paper, any more
than Iam a man spoken by one person is contradicted by Iam not a man, spoken
by another. (See Wyclif's acute remarks ou this subject, pp. 240 and ²4¹ to 1. 11.)
