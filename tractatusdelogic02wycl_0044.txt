XL INTRODUCTION.

student will no doubt find Vitellio's works in any great library. — One
of Wyclif’s mistakes struck me. He denies that the visual rays cross
each other in the centre of the eye. If they did, he says, flzey would
form cm inzverfed image! This shows how little philosophers of that time
cared for experimental tests; for nothing would have been easier7 even
then, than to examine the image formed and find out that it really was
inverted (p. 1757 l. 22 to end of ch. VH),

Chapter VIII. Of Conditional Propositions. Wyclif deals rather
more at length with them than with the others; but he soon turns away
to the problem of individuation, and thence to the question of the so-
called Insolubles.

Logicians generally hold that such a proposition as, JfA is Β, C
is D, does not posit the existence of anything‚ but merely affirms a
connection between two propositions (p. 186, l. 14—16). Wyclif denies
this rule, though granting that it possesses an element of truth (l. 23 - 31).
Every proposition of this kind is either necessary or impossible. If ne-
cessary, its truth implies God’s existence, on whom all truth depends3
if impossible, it implicitly denies that He exists. Here occur some details
about necessary truth. A truth may be at different times both true and
false3 and even at the time when it is false, its having been true is an
eternal truth. The signification of the present may be extended to the
past and the future. A thing true in the abstract may be untrue at a
certain time and imply false inferenceS. If Ι move my hand, I produce
a truth‚ new as to its present actuality, false in the past and the
future, and again everlastingly true in an abstract present <p 188, 189,
l. 1—16).

But, what individualizes such propositions as A will be, was, can
be, cta? That is, what makes one among such propositions uttered in
various circumstances to be true, whilst another of exactly the same
form is false? It is the difference of time, say some. What is eterna] in
itself has a particular (not abstract, but individual) mode of being in
time; and it changes accordingly (p. 189. l 16 to p. 190, l. 3). But if
so, this would infer a continual change in truth; nothing would remain
the same. For time is constantly changing; no one temporal truth could
hold good for more than one instant. And on the other hand, every-
thing would be everlastingly true: before Iam born, and for ever, I am
not-born3 therefore it is everlastingly truc that] am. And the same
