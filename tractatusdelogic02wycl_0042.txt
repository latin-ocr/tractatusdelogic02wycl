XXXVIII INTRODUCTION.

nerally believed that Schoolmen denied the existence of atoms. It would
be more correct to say that they passed them over. They 01 6011156
combated the systems of Democritus and Epicurus; and, finding that the
system 01 11131161 and form sufficed to explain in metaphysical terms all
that was then known 01 natural phenomena‚ they generally did not trouble
themselves to enquire if 3101115 were or were not true in any other sense.
St. Thomas, however, certainly says that there is and must be a limit
to the divisibility of any corporea] substance; but he goes no farther.1
Wyclif, with his principle that a limit not reached is not a limit‚ cannot
help admitting atoms (p. 163, l. 13—22). He grants, in answer to
objections made, that the combination or decomposition 01 two atoms is
instantaneous; but this does not prevent the 61161111631 change 01 1116 whole
from taking up a certain time (p. 163, l. 23—31; p. 164, 1.13-31). To the
well-known difficulty, urged even in our days by Ultra-Thomists against
such Neo-Scholastics as believe in a ‘minimum naturale', viz.‚ that such
a theory would reduce compound bodies to mere aggregates, similar to
so many heaps 01 sand, he denies the conclusion in the case 01 organic
bodies, which have a supervening form that gives unity to the whole3
but whether homogeneous inanimate substances are mere aggregates is,
he says, a doubtful point (p. 163, l. 31—413 p. 164, 1. 31 10 p. 165,
l. 37). Division is favourable to chemical change; and on that account
alchemists calcine metals‚ to give them the more perfect forms (v. g.
that of gold, or ς3111611γ’). But, as this 6316111311011 does not reduce the
metals to their ultimate parts, the successful result of their experiments
is ever 3 11131161 of chance. — We have thus: 1³1, 1116 elementary forms
in the atoms‚ and 2¹¹³, those 01 the compound: simple in themselves,
these forms are to a certain degree extended in the bodies of the lower
animals, which accounts for their continuing to live, although divided
into several parts. As 101· monsters with double organs, they are pro-
perly two animals joined in one, and possess two forms, or vital prin-
ciples (p. 165, l. 37 10 p. 167, l. 34).
