INTRODUCTION. XXV

siders as possible only such as are so in reality‚ and at one time or
other must exist: this does away with all the difficulties that can be
brought forward (pp. 86—88). The system in vogue at his time, refusing
to limit God’s power of creating all that is possible in the abstract‚
renders it necessary to deny that such a multitude is infinite. Wyclif,
limiting God’s power by His will, calls the fixed number of possible
things that will be produced, infinite to us (p. 88 to end of chapter).

Chapter V. brings us to a discussion of causal propositions, after
the writer’s usual fashion, expounding his vicws on causeS, accidents,
modes of being, the identity of God causing Man with Man caused by
God, and the origin of evil.

Of such propositions there are two kinds, the one affirmative, the
other negative, and each is reducible to a categorical having the same
sense. A conditional proposition does not imply causation‚ but only a
nexus between two propositions, neither does a copulative, which means
nothing beyond the coexistence of the two (pp. 90, 91). Accidents are
caused by their subjects: because you are a man, you have such and
such qualities. This is a proof that accident and subject are distinct
entities, unless we deny the truth of causal propositions in general; but such
a denial would be subversive of all science (p. 91, l. 12—39). ‘Cause’
cannot properly be defined, any more than ‘being', because their spheres
are equally universal. We can only state that the word signifies ‘that
which produces an effect³, that of which the entity precedes the thing
caused; whilst ‘effect’ is that other being produced, and of which the
entity flows from that cause. All beings are causes and effects. Possibly
there is no last being, but there is a first one3 which is, according to
Wyclif, not God, but Essence. This essence is that which is created
(unum creatum); but it is itself neither created nor caused. In short, it
seems identical with that Transcendent Being‚ of which we have already
heard a good deal, and which is common both to God and to the
creature; a conception so closely verging upon Pantheism that Wyclif
avoids that conclusion only by his surprising skill in argument, and the
constant employment of the highest mysteries of the Christian saith used
as points of comparison and instances to maintain the value of his
subtle distinctions (p. 91, l. 39, 4o; p. 92, l. 1—18).

He then proceeds to enumerate the fourfold division of causes into

material, formal, efficient and final, each of which is a cause either per
