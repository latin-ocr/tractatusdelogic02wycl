XXVIII INTRODUCTION.

I am — i. e. —— infinitely beneath God — and changes nothing in Him
(pp. 101—103, 1. 8).

And how would Wyclif‚ according to these lines, have answered
the He'gelian puzzle of the Ego and the Non-Ego? With the utmost ease.
My thinking of an object does not change the object in itself; it only
makes it to be thought. The Non-Ego is the Ego — in ⁴my mind. Not
otherwise. My Ego, in thinking —— i. e. mentally‚ is identical with the
Non-Eg0; but only in so far. All this is merely a verbal, or if you
prefer, a notional becoming. And the bubble is burst.

From this Wyclif concludes that no inherent accident has any
existence of its own, or adds anything to its substance, as a substance
(p. 103, l. 8—25); that every proposition of which the predicate essen-
tially belongs to the subject infers a causal proposition, but not vice
versa (for instance: Man is essentially rational: man is rational because
he is man, but, [exist because God wills my existence gives no inference;
p. 103, l. 25 to p. 104, 1. 7); that a conclusion from a cause to the
cause of that cause is a true one (p. 104, l. 7 to end); :ind that, while
God's will causes my existence in the physical order, my existence causes
God's will to be what it is in the intellectual order, i. 6,, a cause. One
of the two gives the entity, but does not prove the existence of the
other3 whilst the latter proves the existence of the former, but does not
give it entity (p. 105, l. 1 to p. 106, 1. 9). It does not follow that either
is prior to the other, unless in two totally different orders: that of
being, and that of cognition (p. 106, l. 9—25). Nor that God’s will,
being a mere relation between the Creator and the Created‚ cannot
cause anything (l. 26—34). Nor that any creature, to be willed‚ must
first of all exist (l. 34—37; p. 107, 1. 1-8).

But can we draw the following negative inference from a causal
proposition: «I do good because God wills in· therefore, zjf God does nol
will it, Ido not good because God does not will it? It is the very same
form of syllogism as the conclusive one which follows: The day exisls
because the sun slzz'nes,· therefore, if tlte sun does azot slzt'ne, Ηιι1 day does
not exist because tlte sun does nol slzine. Some <leny this3 others explain the
inference, noting that we may suppose the sun not to shine on the earth¹

1 I have here slightly developed what I believe to be Wyclif‘s meaning. [11
other placeS, I have not scrupled to add a comparison 01· a line of explanation of
my own, to render the sense clearer.
