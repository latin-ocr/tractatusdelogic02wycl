INTRODUCTION. XLV

true,· true, because it is an existing thing. When we inquire if it has
any truth beyond this, we are forced to reply in the negative. A pro-
position reflecte(l‚ so to speak, back upon itself, can mean nothing but
itself3 and in so far as it seems to mean something else, it is false. Thus
every such proposition is both true and false, though in different ways
(p. 205, l. 35, 36). In the case of the tyrant and his bridge‚ Wyclif
cuts the Gordian knot by shortly stating that such a case would never
happen; and that if it did, the man should be made to pass over (no
doubt because in either case the attendants would fail to do their duty,
and it mattered not what they did). As for the two slaves, mentioned
above, it is doubtful whether they have not fulfilled the conditions of
freedom imposed by their master; and as the law is in favour of liberty
(eo quod jura faveant libertati) they ought both to be set free (p. 208,
l. 8 to p. 209, l. 24).

A little further, Wyclif explains his theory more clearly still. Let
C stand for the proposition: lee meaning of C is true. This is true in
the sense that C exists. True also, in that it means something, viZ., itself.
But false, if it be taken to mean anything further (p. 216, l. 14 to p. 219,
l. 5). Here it is clear that Wyclif, saying that such a proposition is
unmeaning in the third sense, says what amounts to affirming that it is no
proposition at all, as we understand the word nowadays. For him, the word
has a far wider extension. Every thing is a proposition (Log. vol. Ι. p.
15, l. 12—22)‚ because it signifies itself‚ and makes itself known; he
cannot therefore refuse to call an cinsoluble³ by that name. But what le
says, stripped of the numerous intricacies and subtleties which render
this part of his work very difficult to understand, comes, I think, to
the same. μ

One word more before we conclude. It is easy to be seen, from
many different answers given to this question, that at Wyclif's time it was
considered to be a very important and difficult problem3 and also that
Wyclif, having laboured hard, and in the main successfully, to solve it,
is entitled to the just praise which he felt that he deserved. His closing
words, both modest and dignificd, may be quoted here.

“This matter has given me more trouble and occupied me for a
longer space of time than any other part of Logic. Nor do Ι doubt that
every one of the authors of the six above—mentioned theories has also
bestowed much care on the truths which they have discovered relative
