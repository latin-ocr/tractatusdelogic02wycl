INTRODUCTION. VII

They might indeed be classified according to the first principle of
abstract Being. For instance: Whatever is, is, ancl it is; is anything is,
it is; it is wlzilst it is, and so on (p. 3, l. 1—6; p. 7, 1. 5—10). But
God's existence is the first truth of all; no other can be known per-
fectly without it, and in that sense it is prior even to the principle of
contradiction, though both are equally primitive as regards the truths
which flow from them (pp. 7, 8). ’

Other words might de employed to form new species of hypo-
thetical propositione (p. 3, l. 13—30). But they may always be analyzed
into one of those already given. Neitlzer — nor, for instance, means the
same as and with a negative (pp. 8, 9). These propositions may be
combined with each other to the number of 120; but this does not
increase the number of primary species, For ifI say, A is B if C is D,
because E is F, it is a causal proposition; but if we have, A is Β, if
C is D because E is F, the proposition is conditional (pp. 9, 10). Here
Wyclif solves a number of sophisms at considerable length. It was no doubt
useful and even necessary for students of those times to know them; a
the present day, most of us would, for all these sophisms, endorse our
author's opinion concerning certain among them, and say with him:
sunt mihi odibiles (p. 14, l. 5). It is, however, worth while to note his
remark that a sentence, however, long it may be, is a proposition, pro-
vided it imply one predominant act of the mind; where there are several
it is not one proposition, and can neither be affirmed nor denied as
one. The affirmation or negation bears upon the hypothetical sign. God
exists, and you are an ass, is denied without any reference to its com-
ponent parts separately (p. 10).

But there seems to have been a personal argument, particularly
directed against Wyclis’s theory of universals, which may be noticed
apart. We must remember that the universal “animal³³‚ in this theory, is
a real thing or entity, identical both in men and in brutes. So we have:
“You are now whatever you would he, if you were an ass; in that case
you could bray; therefore you can now.³³ This somewllat humorous
syllogism is gravely discussed, for it entails grave consequences. Wyclif
not only grants that the major premiss is true, but that the minor is
necessary (p. 10, l. 35—41); but this is quite natural, if we refer to his
theory. He answers, however, that though a man is identical with an
ass, the identity is only partial. What would be necessary to conclude
