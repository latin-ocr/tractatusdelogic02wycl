observations concerning the nature of promises and obligations (pp. 60,
61) with which he deals at some length. He then takes up a series of
objections, in which absurdities, very similar to those of which he accuses
his adversaries, are laid to his charge.

1. We are never obliged to give anything but what we have pro-
mised. If then the promise concerns only a universal penny, nothing
obliges us to give a singular one! Besides, as we may suppose that the
other party has a (universal) penny already, how can we give a man
what he possesses? So the Realist, not the Nominalist, standpoint is the
ruin of promises, obligations, and in short of all human intercourse
whatsoever (p. 61, l. 26—37).

The answer is that we are indeed not obliged to give anything
but a universal penny, since no other is promised. But that we are
obliged to give3 and since it cannot be given without the singular which
contains it, any one of its singulars must be handed over. As to the
man’s already possessing a universal penny, that has nothing to do with
the matter: he must possess it in reason of the promise made, even though
he had it already, and independently thereos. He then will have it in one
more of its singulars, i. e. more plentisully (abundantius). Wyclif adds, with
a touch of dry and possibly unconscious humour, that the multiplied pos-
session of a universal penny in its singulars is highly advantageous
(multum confert). Thus, if a promise concerns the Universal‚ its execu-
tion regards its singulars (p. 62, l. 16 to p. 63, 1. 5). That the common
people know nothing of universals is quite false; they have a sort of
confused knowledge of them. Even those who deny their existence cannot
help contradicting themselves and agreeing with us in practice (p. 63, l. 15
to p. 64, 1. 7).

2. “Eun'' the adversary urges, «1 for one deny the existence, even
the possibility of a real universal penny. So, at least when I promise
one, the promise must be that of a singular: Ireally mean to give, and
Ι cannot mean what is in my opinion impossible. Thus universality is
not necessarily implied by the words of the promise in my case; andis
not in my case, in none³³ (p. 61, 1. 37 to p. 62, l. 5). “Quite the con-
trary,³' replies Wyclif. “You may intend promising one particular penny
—— the one, for instance, that you will happen to give — but you
cannot help implicitly meaning the Unive1·sal which it contains. No doubt
it is promised vaguely in this case3 still it is promised. That you have
