Tentlz Report of thiAEerutligzGCgommc'tbee, for 1896.
φη, .

THE continued help that the Society gets from its printer,
Mr. Carl Georg Fromme of Vienna, combined With the
devotion of its editors, Μ. Dziewicki and Prof. Loserth, aided
by Mr. Matthevv, alone enables it to produce its books in
time, and in advance.

The volume for 1896, comprising the third and fourth
parts of Wyclif's Opus EvanyeMcmn, edited by Prof. Loserth,
is bound and ready for issue.

The volumes for 1897 and 1898, De Logyz'oa II, edited by
M. H. Dziewicki, and De Se'mom'a, edited by Prof. Dr.
Herzberg-Fr'ankel and M. H. Dziewicki, are in the binders'
hands, and can be issued next month to any Members who
will pay the two years’ subscription in advance.

owes Mr. Fromme 58350 for* its three volumes of 1896-8,
and it has about enough in hand to pay its binders for
covering these volumes. The Oommittee therefore appeal
to Members for three years’ advance subscriptione at once,
so that a fresh start may be made, free from all liability,
at the future years' work, 1899-191‘2.
