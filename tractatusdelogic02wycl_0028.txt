XXIV INTRODUCTION.

Wyclif speaks of necessity, he may mean that, given the fact of free-
will and the actions resulting therefrom, things cannot be otherwise than
they are; this, however, is often set forth in language which must have
astonished the ordinary Catholic. In Buddensieg's edition of Wyclif’s
Polemical Works there is a tract entitled De Perfectz'one Statuam, in
which (vol. II, p. 450, l. 5—18) a passage occurs that evidently sup-
poses free-will. Now this tract, according to Buddensieg, dates from 1383,
quite at the close of our author's life. But, on the other hand, this, as
directed against the Friars, may be explained away as an argument ead
hominem’. And in the Dialogus, when accused of fatalism, he might
easily have destroyed the charge by the well-known distinction between
absolute and hypothetical necessity. Yet he gives none, and simply ad-
mits the necessity of all things that happen (Dial. pp. 45, 46). That
some change or other took place in Wyclif's doctrine is evident from
the following passage in De Ecclesia (p. 107, 1. 12 and seq.), in which
he explicitly admits the fact: “Omnia fittura de necessitate eveniunt. . . .
Quando autem variavi ab ista sententia, non cognovi, ut modo, quomodo
res habet multiplex esse, sed omne esse posui existentiam individuam rei
in suo genere.’³ How he reconciles this doctrine with free-will is not
quite clear to me, as I have not been able to find a passage dealing
with free-will at any length, except a very orthodox one in De Ente
Praedicamentali (p. 247), but this treatise‚ according to Dr. Beer, could
not have been posterior to Logica by more than a few years. But we
must not rashly assume that he did not reconcile them. The Dominicans‚
in their great controversy with the Jesuits, affirmed that God predeter-
mined all human acts, making all things act according to their nature;
so that, as the nature of will is to act freely, human acts were at once
predetermined and free! And this theory was not condemned by the
Church! - Having thrown out these few hints which may possibly be
of use, I return to the summary of Wyclif’s arguments,

The distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic possibility has no
real foundation. A seemingly possible soul is in reality impossible, if
God has chosen never to create it. The number therefore of souls
extrinsically possible is that of all those which at any time will exist in
reality; it is consequently finite, though the abstract idea, ‘Soul’ contains
an infinite multitude of singulars; for all those singulars to which their

cause (i. e. God’s will) is wanting, imply sels-contradiction. Wyclif con—
