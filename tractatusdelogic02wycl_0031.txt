INTRODUCTION. XXVII

not the same. Size gives a man magnitude; quality gives him ‘suchness’,
humanity alone gives him to be a man (p. 99, l. 4 to p. 100, l. ὁ).

But if so, another difficulty springs up. God, as creating man, has
what is called an accidental mode, which is not identical with His
essence, and therefore is posterior to Himself! And if we deny this; if
we say that this mode is identical with God's essence, we fall into
another snare: for the said mode (action and passion being admittedly
the same thing taken from contrary points of view) is also identical
with man as created by God (p. 100, l. 6 to end). Thus God and man
would share in the same reality‚ or mode of existence; just as the
hammer qua striking the anvil, is identical with the auvil, qua struck by
the hammer. It is curious to note how this old-world objection has been
reproduced and extended in modern times. Every student of Philosophy
will at once recognize the system which says: “I think of an object:
——· therefore I am identical with the object, the Non-Ego. And the Non-
Ego, thought by me, becomes identical with my Ego.'³ What was for-
merly an objection, refuted in a few pages, has become the starting
point and basis of many a volume of German metaphysical speculation,
which, having spent its force and lost its interest in its own country,
has lately found new life and men of talent to expound it in England.
And yet this fallacy (to speak of it in the language of the Schoolmen)
was well known veven in Aristotle's time, Truly there is no new thing
under the sun! But let us see how Wyclif refutes it.

First, he points out that an accident may signify a mere happening
which does not in the least change the possessor's intrinsic nature: a
rich man may become poor without any loss to his physical attributes.
He then notes that not all relations are mutually real. A cause must be,
in its essence, prior to its effect, though it is only properly termed a
cause whilst the effect is being produced. This ‘calling³‚ or denomination,
changes nothing in its being. So, the cause depends on the effect only
in so far as a verbal change is implied, whereas the effect depends on
the cause for its very being. A man, by means of his generative acti-
vity, produces a son: he is called a father as soon as his son exists.
But the man existed before and independently; there is no real difference
between the father and the man. Wyclif therefore answers that the
likeness of me in God and the likeness of God in me, both produced
by creation, are not identical. For the likeness of me represents me as
