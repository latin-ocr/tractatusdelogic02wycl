XXXII INTRODUCTION.

Jevons have in turn endeavoured to adapt Algebra to Logic or Logic to
Algebra, whilst Abbe Gratry‚ in France‚ has tried to prove God and the
Creation by the interpretation of certain mathematical formulae. And, to
restrict myself to Mediaeval Scholasticism, we by no means find Wyclif
alone in his way of looking at ideas — or rather at their universal
objects — as though they were measurable things. Here Ι must regret
not having taken note, in times gone by, of several passages of
St. Thomas, in which he distinctly speaks, for instance, of the distance
between the most perfect brute and man as greater than that between
the former and a plant. Here we see' an explicit comparison between
two entitative differences. There are also in his works certain arguments
which, though referring to pure abstractions, might very well be repre-
sented by an algebraical equafion, if we admitted the assumption already
mentioned. Ι equally regret not being able now to find the passages I
refer to; but life would be too short to look through the multitudinous
folios of the Angelic Doctor; I had to glance here and there, where I
thought I had most chance to find them. One argument, I remember
well, struck me as being based on the implicit assumption that tcwhen
two variable quantities (or objects of ideas) are always equal to 'each
other as they approach the constants by which they are respectively
limited‚ those constants are also equal to each other³³. And we may
fairly believe that if, in the days of Schoolmen, mathematics had attained
the high degree of development at which they stand now, there would
have been wrought a complete transformation of Metaphysics; not per-
haps to its disadvantage.

Setting aside the detailed examination of the debate, as useless
and uninteresting to us, we may however notice by the way what Wyclif,
in his answer to the fourth objection, remarks concerning goodness
(p. 122 to and of chapter). Utility has no intrinsic element of goodness3
it is good only extrinsically, and varies according to the demand for the
thing that is useful. But reversely‚ whatever possesses intrinsic goodness
possesses utility too; so does also that which is bad in itself3 for even
sin has its use in the world. Intrinsical goodness is divided into two
species: that which is physically and that which is morally good. The
latter is always useful‚ at least to some extent; virtue never can be
badly employed; yet it may at times be less useful than what is merely
extrinsically good. The same division of evil must be 1nade; it is either
