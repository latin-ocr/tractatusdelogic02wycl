XXII INTRODUCTION.

many more: which would not be true, if all possible men existed at any
time (p. 79, l. 22 to p. 81, l. 6).

But this flatly contradicts Wyclif’s principles. To answer the argu-
ments levelled against him, he makes a very remarkable and peculiar
use of the term ‘infinite³. He indeed affirms the existence of an infinite
number, but says that whatever exceeds our power of knowing distinctly,
is infinite to us. Thus, to give his own comparison — a striking one ——
in a given line there is a definite and fixed number of points, known to
God, but absolutely beyond our powers of apprehension. As a fact, we
must admit the existence of continuous extension: now, how many parts
are there in any such extended being? The more we divide it, the
more of thern we find, *and we never can get to the end of our division.
Yet God, who created them, knows each in particular, and the sum
total of them all (p. 81, l. 6—33).

Would Wyclif have considered the multitude of stars in the sky,
or that of the sands on the sea-shore, to be infinite? I think not; for
they do not exceed our faculty of counting, but the time we have allotted
to us, or the instruments we are obliged to use3 if we had time enough,
their aggregate would be represented by a number, finite even to us.
He takes an instance of quite a different nature; — we might go on
counting for all eternity the number of points in a line, or of parts in
a given volume, however small. Yet he contends that as those points
are really there (again a consequence of his doctrine3 a Nominalist
would get out of the difficulty by saying that they were mere entia
rationis), it is impossible both that their number should not be known
to God, and that it should be infinite to Him. It is therefore definite.
To the length of each line corresponds a fixed number of points; a line
double that length will have twice as many; numbers beyond all arith-
metical calculation, but numbers nevertheless. The idea is not wanting
in boldness and originality; but, like all speculations on these subjects,
it is liable to a good many formidable objections.

Wyclif strengthens his position by observing that certain proposi-
tions which are evidently true must be denied if we refuse to admit this
conception of the Infinite. A body certainly consists of all its parts; but,
were there no definite number, there would be no all,· the very term
supposes them either counted or at least numerable. Again‚ in Genesis,
“God saw all the things that He had made,³³ i. e. with all their details,
