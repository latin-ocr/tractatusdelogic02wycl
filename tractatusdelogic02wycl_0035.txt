singulars, Life, including Animality3 Substance, including Life3 and the
infinite line would stand for Transcendent Being‚ including all. The
following figure will sufficiently show my meaning:

Singulars of the Universal Man, or Humanity.

But it is quite clear that this objection goes to make Wyclif con-
tradict himself. In so far as any man shares more perfectly in humanity,
in so far he shares in it less perfectly! Of course the arguments are
all grossly fallacious; but the subject itself is too important to let them

pass without careful refutation.

In the second place, we may notice the tendeney of Scholastie
philosophy to apply the mathematical method to metaphysical reasoning.
We have seen cases somewhat similar to this in Logica before; but
nowhere does Wyclif mark it so strongly as here. He even goes the
length of supposing numbers set down to denote the entitative perfee-
tions of diverse species (pp. 119, 120) and points out the fallaey of
reasoning upon such numbers, if they do not stand for homologous
things ——- I had almost said, quantities: for he evidently has in his
mind the intensity of essential perfection‚ when he numbers them thus.
This seems to have been a tendency more or less to be found in phi-
losophers of all ages, who could not help admiring the fruitful accuraey
of the mathematical method‚ and contrasting it with the barren vagueness
of their own speculations. Not to speak of the ancients‚ of the school
of Pythagoras, and of several Curious passages in Plato and Aristotle,
we find a good many traces of this spirit in the works of modern phi-
losophers. Spinoza and Wolff attempted to reduce two very different
systems of philosophy to a series of theorems, deduced one, from the
other, like those of Euclid. At the present day, De Mor-gan, Boole and
