XXXIV INTRODUCTION.

The problem is ushered in according to Wyclif's usual fashion;
but it is not dragged in, as occurs in too many cases. Comparative
propositions easily lead to the question whether, wherever there is a
more and a less, there is not also a most and a least, not only existing (which
is generally allowed) but even possible (p. 129; p. 130, l. 1—15). As preli-
minaries to the solution, several principles are laid down concerning God's
power and His concourse in every act of His creatures. All things proceed
from God, and every act of every creature requires an accompanying act of
the Creator, without which that act could not possibly take place.
There is also in Him a distinct and special power for every being,
which, when that being has perished, exists no longer3 but this takes
away nothing from God’s perfection, for it would imply absurdity that
He could act with that which does not exist (pp. 130—132, l. 30).
This power of concourse is a relation in God, but a purely logical one
(p. 132, 1. 30 to p. 133, 1. 11). If there is no maximum intensity of an
act, God cannot elicit it; and if theregis, as we assert‚ such a maximum,
His power itself cannot go beyond it (p. 133, l. 11—25). As God could
do, absolutely speaking, things which cannot really be done, Wyclif
objects to the theory which distinguishes His absolute from His ordinate
power3 the former cannot be exercised alone, and therefore is inad-
missible. In any case, every being has power to act only so far as it
is possible for God to coact with it (p. 133, l. 25 to p. 135, l. 10).

Every finite power or active faculty must have a maximum of
activity, beyond which it cannot go. Being finite, it is limited, and the
very idea of limit implies a maximum (p. 135, l. 21 to end). We may
suppose it to be variable, increasing uniformly during a certain time; it
then will become successively twice, three times, &c.‚ as great as it
was at first: that is, its limit of maximum performance lies twice, &c.,
as far as before; ΞΟ, even in this case, it still has its limit (p. 136,
1. 16 to end). The modern mathematical notion of a limit —-— that which
a variable quantity may approach indefinitely, but never reach — finds
scant favour with Wyclif. What cannot be done is not the limit of what
can. A given weight — say, a stone -— that I am unable to carry is not
the limit of my strength; unless indeed it be the least weight that I cannot
carry, and that is an assumption impossible to prove (p. 138, l. 7—23).
