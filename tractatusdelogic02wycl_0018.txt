XIV lNTRODUCTION.

It would bc a false argument to say: “Manhood is a thing identical with
Socrates and with Plato: therefore, Socrates is Plato.³³ In like manner,
to say: “Being is God and is Not-God3 therefore God is Not-God'³ —
is false too (p. 38, l. 10—34). We may say: c‘That which (meaning, or
as Wyclif says, pointing to, demonstrans, Transcendental Being) is Not-
God is G0d;³³ but we cannot infer thence that the creature is God
(pp. 38, 39). But to admit even the former proposition seems perilously
near Pantheism: so we must not be surprised if Wyclif reverts to this
point and supports his distinction with analogies drawn from the pro-
foundest mysteries of the Christian religion.'

Third. To grant that the Universal Man is identical with each of
its singulars seems to imply its doing and being all that every individual
does and is. It is thus at the same time awake and asleep, white and
blank, &c., together with countless other contradictory attributes (p. 39,
1. 38 to end3 p. 40, 1. 1—14). This objection may be solved either nega-
tively or in the affirmative. Man is that which is white and that which
is black; but Man is not white and black. For, as a universal, this term
can receive no predicates but such as are essential to human nature:
and it is evident that neither whiteness nor blackness are thus essential
(p. 4Ο,.1. 15 to p. 42, 1. 6). But again, taking ideal humanity as the
exemplar and prototype of each man, and consequently as the cause of
each, we may grant that it does every one of the actions of each. So
universals do receive accidents: not indeed in themselves, but in their
singulam, with which they are identical: and the countless different attri-
butes, which are or may be contradictory in their singulam, are not so
in them (p. 42, l. 5—25). This explanation is similar to that of theolo-
gians, who deny that the Godhead suffered, although it was that which
suffered, i. e. the person of Christ (p. 42, l. 28 to p. 44, l. 25). Several
other objections are propounded and solved in the same way, by pointing
either to the mystery of the Incarnation or to that of the Trinity; in the
latter, the essence of the Deity is substantially the same in each of the
three persons; yet the Three are really distinct. The Father is not the Son,
although that which is the Father is that which is the Son. “To every
sophism against Real Universals, you can find a parallel one against the
Holy 'I‘rinity,³³ says Wyclif (p. 46, l. 18—22). Very true3 and it there-
fore follows that, sor α Christian, the distinction is not meaningless,

meaningless as it may seem. But the following would seem an obvious
