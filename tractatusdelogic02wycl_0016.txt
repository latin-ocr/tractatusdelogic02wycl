Moderate Realists. To ascribe the universality 01 0111 ideas to a mere
groundless fiction of the mind would destroy the objective value of all
reasoning. To suppose that there exists a mysterious something, substan-
tially identical in each and all of 1116 singular objects that come under 3
general name, would land us in endless difficulties, with which we shall
50011 566 Wyclif attempting to grapple. They therefore draw 3 sharp
distinction between the Universal, 35 301 5663 by the mind, and 35 5663.
The Universal, 35 foi-mally existing in many singulars, 15 nowhere but in
the mind. Everything that exists in 11311116 15 formally concrete, and sin-
gular in 115 6556366. Thus the Universal, as known, is nothing but 3
111616 abstraction. But, as able to be known, it 15 011161·1ν156; 11 15 1631;

avoid defending 3 position which they consider unsafe, and take up one
which it is very difficult to attack with any chance 0151166655. Asked by
Nominalists if the redness of the rose, the geranium, and the cherry, is
a 1631 universal, they reply: Its reality is formally in the objects, funda-
1361113111ν in the mind; its universality is formally in the mind, fundamen-
tally in the objects. Asked by those of Wyclilf's school 11 111616 15 nothing
identical in two shades of colour in which there is no difference‚ they
answer: Nothing but the aptitude they have for being grasped in one
idea3 that aptitude‚ in objects similarly coloured, really exists3 and when
our mind thus grasps them, it becomes actual — but only in the mind.
This may seem obscure, but I 633 find no words to state it more
clearly: and indeed this seems to me the true solution of the whole
problem. Ι do not see what the most determined Nominalist could find
to attack in this reply‚ if he understood it properly. It might perhaps
not satisfy him; for it keeps up 3 511161 16131103 between signs, ideas,
and things, between the subjective and the objective order, and maintains
the validity of human „reason without restrictions, in whatever Splzere if
may worse. But it a'voids with the utmost 6316 giving a handle 10111115
